gitignore - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected

You can create a .gitignore file in your repository's root directory to tell Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit. 

Open Git Bash.
Navigate to the location of your Git repository.
Create a .gitignore file for your repository.

$ touch .gitignore
